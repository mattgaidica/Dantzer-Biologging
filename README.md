# What is bio-logging?
The use of miniaturized, animal-borne bio-loggers to make physiological and environmental measurements from free-ranging animals is radically transforming scientific capabilities [Williams et al., 2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13094). We have recently explored how to implement these technologies to expand the methods and resolution by which stress and performance are quantified in the wild [Gaidica & Dantzer, 2019](https://ecoevorxiv.org/huxw6/).

### Current Challenges
Bio-logging constraints are not unlike those faced by human-based wearables. We require high-resolution neural and cardiac over long-duration studies in extreme environments. It will take significant strides in recording methodologies and technology to achieve these goals, but _now_ is a great time to pursue these challenges.

Broad, yet ambitious goals should act to focus efforts of the bio-logging community:

1. _Standardize_ data collection and analysis methods.
2. _Communicate_ approaches and insights.
3. _Innovate_ tools and technologies.

We want to make our methods and tools **open source**. You can read more about our approach in [the Wiki](https://github.com/mattgaidica/biologging/wiki/Architecture).

## Why squirrels?

The ecological niche occupied by wild squirrels has been conserved for millions of years and is highlighted by their unique adaptations to arboreal life (i.e., in the trees). Their ability to regulate energy and maintain fitness through a variety of natural and imposed challenges ultimately determine their odds of survival. Little is known about how the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in these natural behaviors. One of our goals is to use bio-loggers to record from the CNS of wild squirrels to understand how their physiology and behavior are correlated, given the varying demands of their environment. Adding resolution to these important ecological factors underlying animal fitness and survival is an important consideration to ongoing conservation work, potentially highlighting what ‘optimal adaptations’ are from a physiological perspective.

### Research Platform
![squirrel platform](https://github.com/mattgaidica/biologging/blob/master/assets/images/squirrel_platform.png?raw=true)
Evolutionary pressures on wild animals provide advantageous platforms for study because behavior is tightly linked with measures of fitness. How mammalian physiology copes and adapts in response to changing environments is an important question that can benefit from the added resolution of bio-loggers. Technical challenges not unique to ecology are also approachable through this model and platform.
