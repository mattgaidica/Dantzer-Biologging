- 3D printer delivered by Chris
- Auto-home was not working, wouldn't calibrate, grinding sound on y-axis
- Tried loosening y-axis belt a little, no change
- Tried loosening y-axis u-bolt (bearing), no change
- Found y-axis was binding without motor/belt attached
-- Removed heatbed, removed y-axis plate: bearings still binding to rods
-- Removed and cleaned rods with isopropyl, no change
-- Oiled bearings and rods, now they glide freely! Put back together
- Everything works: re-calibrated xyz, first layer (didn't realize filament was PETG)
-- only calibrating/testing with supplied filament
- Successfully printed PETG squirrel, switching to own PLA filament
